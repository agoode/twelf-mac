Example Code
============

I dug some of these examples out of [MPW
3.3](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/545-macintosh-programmer-s-workshop-mpw-3-x)
and, after googling for PASCALCLIKLOOP, which occurs in
`TESampleGlue.a`, I found the others in

- https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/project/net_dev/OldFiles/techinfo.mac/src/textMgr.c
- http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Development/Documentation/www/devdoc/portPPC.html
- https://www.x.org/archive//unsupported/programs/MacFS/MacFontUI.c

but I think, since the MPW code does in fact define PascalClikLoop,
what I'm probably seeing is simply other programs that started from
that sample code.
